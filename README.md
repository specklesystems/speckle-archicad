## Documentation

Comprehensive developer and user documentation can be found in our:

#### ðŸ“š [Speckle Docs website](https://speckle.guide/dev/)

## This Readme Template

Is rather straightforward. It includes several default sections and one section that requires special attention.

Default sections:

- Badges: has several default social badges. Feel free to add more.
- Developing & Debugging - needs filling in!
- Community - can be left as is.

**License section**: If this is a pure OSS repo, like Core, remove everything after the first phrase. Otherwise, we need to plan ahead before releasing and make sure we're covered.

## Developing & Debugging
