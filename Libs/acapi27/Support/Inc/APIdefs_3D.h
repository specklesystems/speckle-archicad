	@remarks The 3D representation of a particular element is based on the @ref API_BodyType structure.
	One element may hold one or more bodies to describe the 3D geometry.
	Generally, a body is built up from several vertices, edges, polygons, and normal vectors.
	This data structure gives you the number of internal components, some status bits, surface properties, and a global transformation matrix.
	You also get a reference to the parent element through an @ref API_Elem_Head structure.
	You can get a body component just after you call @ref ACAPI_ModelAccess_GetComponent with the appropriate body component.
	Then you can obtain edges, pgons, vertices etc. of that body.
	Use indices from 1 to `nPgon`, `nPedg`, `nEdge`, `nVert`, or `nVect` in the parameter of @ref ACAPI_ModelAccess_GetComponent function to get a subcomponent.
	The status field specifies some properties of the body. You can use the bitwise-OR operator (|) to combine any of the following constants:
- @c APIBody_MulRtxt : more textures are referenced by its materials.
- @c APIBody_MulColor : more than one colors referenced by its edges.
- @c APIBody_MulMater : more than one materials referenced by its polygons.
- @c APIBody_Closed : its geometry is closed.
- @c APIBody_Curved : it has smooth polygons.

	transition is smoother.) The effect of the light is limited along the axis by the `dist1` and `dist2`
	clipping values. The `dfall` parameter controls the decrease in intensity depending on the distance. (Zero
	value means a constant intensity, bigger values are used for stronger falloff.) The type of light source can be

		Before you try to understand how the 3D model corresponds to the API structures, please read carefully the Primitive Elements chapter in the GDL Reference Manual.
		The 3D geometry itself is described by the @ref API_PgonType, @ref API_PedgType, @ref API_EdgeType, @ref API_VertType and @ref API_VectType structures.
		Negative index referring to an edge or a normal vector indicates that the component should be interpreted reversed. In this case require the component using the absolute value of the index, but consider the edge directing from the second vertex to the first one, or when retrieving a normal vector, invert its coordinates.
		The 3D representation also owns a common pool of the surface materials. The polygon instances of the geometry description refer to these materials by indices. One surface definition is described by the @ref API_UmatType structure. Surface materials may come from two sources. The list of materials contains all the global material attributes which are referenced by any polygon of the 3D geometry. Materials may be defined in GDL scripts also.
		Elements placed with the light tool on the floorplan may contain light emissions, defined via GDL scripts. All of the light sources present in the 3D geometry are described with the @ref API_LghtType structure.
