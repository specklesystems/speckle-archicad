The database cannot be modified by the user, the input and edit functionality on these windows are disabled for the user.
		These type of windows are excellent to visualize the output of your algorithms, for example in case of listings. An add-on can open any number of drawing and text windows at the same time.
		Once an add-on opens such a window, it will be responsible for rebuilding its content when it is necessary. Archicad will post notifications for such an event. Upon receiving a notification Archicad will pass the windowPars->userRefCon parameter to the add-on to identify which window it should work on.
